# Final Project Paradata

## Implementation

### How this project is organised

This project is organised into three parts.

The first part is a combination of two sub parts. Each their own separate topic model. Part one sets out to explore the MSU [Feeding America: The Historic American Cookbook Project](http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/) on a larger scale. the first sub part consists of my first topic model of the collection and includes graphs and charts to visualize the information. There I also discuss stop words because in the first part I did not use a list of stop words. The final bit of information I go over in Part 1.1 are the actual topics. I take a look at what the top topic is and suggest that more needs to be done with the material to better understand. Which brings us to the second sub part. Here I increased the number of topics and included a list of stop words. I then used the same graphs as Part 1.1 as to make comparison easier. Here I confirm my suspicions from 1.1, and add some additional information about how the two differ and possible reasons why.

Part two consisted of five sub parts. The goal of this portion of the project was to examine what happens when you separate the the cookbooks by decade and use the topic modeling tool on a smaller portion of documents. As with Part 1 each of Part 2's sub sections contains the same 5 visualizations of the data for each of the topic models. At the beginning of Part 2 I discuss some of the issues that occurred. Then I examine the first five decades of cookbooks from the Feeding America: The Historic American Cookbook Project. In each subsection I discuss the decade modeled, its relation to the ones before it, I point out irregularities and suggest some possible reasons for them. Then I take a look at the topics themselves and see what changes there are in both the 'top topics' as well as others. I looked mainly for changes in ingredients and preparation.

The third and Final part of the Project is the conclusion. Here I discussed my results, how this project could be used by other historians, and what I learned from the experience.

## Aims and Methods

### How I did it and Why?

My aim for this project was quite simple, my methods on the other hand were not. My main goal was to really experiment with the Topic Modeling Tool and different types of data visualization. I wanted to spot trends and irregularites and make suggestions for further study. I had decided to use the Feeding America: The Historic American Cookbook Project for a couple reasons. The first being avalibility and the second being food history is a very informative branch of social history. Meaning that the patterns I find through visualization could lead other historians to make interesting cultural discoveries.

My method was a bit fragmented and chaotic, but it definitely worked for me. I actually kept an account of what I was doing in my Github [Final Project]( https://github.com/CatharineVanStarkenburg/Final-Project-/blob/master/Final%20Project/FinalProjectnotesandthoughtsonprocess.mdown) repository. Most of my repository remains unedited, but should you like a more in depth and disorganized view of my method please feel free to take a look. But my method overall consisted of topic modeling, looking for patterns; running the tool again with different perimeters, looking for patterns; examining the patterns together; asking for lots of help; and creating interesting visuals. While that does not sound particularly difficult the repetitive nature of the activity made it a challenge. Also my relative inexperience with both the topic of food history and using topic modeling (something I had never hear of until a few weeks ago) made the project a challenge.

## Research Sources

### Where I got my Ideas, and Who helped shape them

As mentioned on my [About This Project](http://finalproject.catharinevanstar.com/blog/) page I got the idea to use topic modeling from an article written by Cameron Blevins called *Topic Modeling Martha Ballardâ€™s Diary*. How Blevins showed the possibilities of topic modeling really grabbed my attention and I wanted to learn more.

Which brings me to my second research source, Dr. Shawn Graham. It was in the many meetings with Prof. Graham that my project began to take shape. It was with his help that I learned how to use the topic modeling tool and what to do with those topics once I had them. Unfortunately I cannot give you a link to an article about our conversations but I can provide other articles that I found very helpful when preparing this project.

Ted Underwood's work in topic modeling was incredibly helpful. Not only was my list of [stop words](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/45709) provided by him and Andrew Goldstone, but Underwood also has a number of useful things on topic modeling. Underwood's blog post [Visualizing Topic Models]( https://tedunderwood.com/2012/11/11/visualizing-topic-models/) he talks about visualizing a whole topic model instead of just one topic. This is what I tried top replicate with my project. I wanted to get a bigger picture of multiple topics.

## Documentation

All of my documentation for this project has been made available on my Githib [Final Project](https://github.com/CatharineVanStarkenburg/Final-Project-) repository. While it was not completely my choice to have my work be open I am incredibly glad that choice was made. Having all documentation regarding my project available to the public is amazing. In future, should I want to explore my project further I can easily pick up where I left off. The same can be done by anyone. Should another historian come across my work and want work with it or improve it they can. That is really what has made this entire experience so exciting.

## Sustainability

### Where can we go From Here?

As mentioned anyone can continue where my project left off. However, there were some very interesting ideas and suggestions made that could really bring this project to the next level. Some other areas historians could examine are:

*   The effects of immigration 
*   The effects of WWI
*   How changes in culinary technology can be mapped through topic modeling

I could also take this project in many different directions for future interest. I could do visualizations of individual topics. I could do the last five decades and see how the topics evolved. I could look deeper into individual topic and examine the historical forces behind them.

The future possibilities of this project are almost endless.

## Access

As mentioned what is incredible about this whole project is that it is fully accessible to absolutely anyone in the world. Should someone be interesting in doing a similar project they could use some of the information I gathered. Or if they just have a passing interest in the potential of either 'Big Data' or topic modeling they could look at my project as an example.
