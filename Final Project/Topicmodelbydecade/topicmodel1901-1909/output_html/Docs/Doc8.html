 INTRODUCTION 
  This work presents several new ideas in cook books. The size is extremely convenient. It will lie open without taking too much room. The blank pages permit one to copy in or paste into its appropriate place the recipe for each particular kind of dish. This is a valuable innovation, as many housekeepers will be pleased to have a convenient place for preserving recipes that are obtained from friends and other sources.  
  Every recipe herein has been repeatedly tested in the experience of its originator. They have also been fully tested by various committees among the subscribers to the magazine,  Good Housekeeping.  Finally, each recipe as here printed has also been verified and tested by the New England School of Cookery.  
  These recipes represent the everyday routine of cookery, by many of the best cooks and housekeepers both at home and abroad.

 A Few Rules 
 To Be Observed in Cooking from Recipes in This Book. 
 All measurements are level. A cup is the glass measuring cup marked with thirds and quarters. When it is full, it is leveled off smoothly with a dry knife. 
 When flour is to be measured in cupfuls, sift it, then lift with a spoon into a cup. Do not shake or press it down, simply make it full, then run a  spatula  over the top to level it. 
 A tablespoon of butter is measured in the same way. A tablespoon of melted butter means butter melted before measuring. 
 One cup of cream, whipped, means cream measured before whipping. Whipped cream requires measuring after being whipped. 
  A table with a small jar, plate and cup on top of it. A pair of hands holding a spoon close to the cup.  
 Good Housekeeping Table of Weights and Measures 
 When recipes are found which deal with pounds and ounces, and scales are not at hand, the weights may be translated into level measurements, such as are used wholly in the New England School of Cookery. This is easy to do when one knows corresponding amounts. By level measurements are meant a spoon or cup filled full with dry material, then leveled
 
 
off smooth, as shown in the illustration. Flour is sifted before being lifted into the cup or spoon, then leveled, and butter is packed in solid. Use always a measuring cup divided into thirds and quarters.
