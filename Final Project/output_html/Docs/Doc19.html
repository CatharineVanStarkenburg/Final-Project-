 PREFACE. 
 THE importance of the subject treated in this volume will be universally
acknowledged; the only question is, was there a place yet to be filled among
the number of books on cookery? 
 No complete system of Domestic Economy, within the limits of a convenient
manual, has been published in this country; yet in many matters besides cookery
does the inexperienced housewife need instruction and guidance. It has been a
study, in this volume, to reduce to practical rules the best theories
concerning an extensive and varied range of household duties, and to furnish
simple and useful directions in each branch of this most interesting of
sciences, that the work might be safely consulted in all matters relating to
the manifold responsibilities of the housekeeper. 
 While endeavoring to make this manual or cyclopedia so complete as to meet
all the wants of those who lack experience, care has been taken to arrange the
various departments  with clearness and method. A
carefully prepared and copious index will at once direct the reader to any
thing wanted. 
 An unusually large variety of receipts is given for soups, sauces, and
meats; because it was desirable to include the latest improvements, and because
the want of variety in such preparations is generally complained of in American
cookery. The French having so much the advantage of us, it is as well to learn
something more of their boasted art, that those who choose may avail themselves
of the knowledge. A number of choice receipts from very recent French and
English works, have been added to those contributed by American housekeepers of
long experience and tried skill. 
 Some valuable receipts, never made public, have been furnished for this work
by Mr. Delmonico, Mr. Taylor, Mr. Wagner, and Mr. Sneckner,--all proprietors of
celebrated establishments in New York. 
 The Toilet Department, and Perfumery, do not strictly belong to
Housekeeping, but some knowledge of them is desirable for every lady, and fair
readers will not object to the space and attention devoted to these
matters. 
 The Family Medical Guide is not designed to interfere with the province of
the physician, but to furnish simple and approved recipes for use when medical
advice cannot be procured, and palliatives to promote the comfort of the
sick. 
 The Miscellaneous Department will be found to include  many new receipts, as also the section of Preparations for
Invalids. 
 The numerous cuts, illustrating housekeeping articles, &#38;c., contained in
no other work of the kind, are nearly all from drawings furnished to the
Publishers by the kindness of Mr. J. C. Berrian, 601 Broadway, and Mr. Stephen
William Smith, 534 Broadway, near Spring street, New York.

HOUSEKEEPER. 
 PART I.  THOUGHTS AND MAXIMS
ON HOUSEKEEPING. 
 
 CHAPTER I. 
 DR. STARK says, "The only test of the utility of knowledge is its promotion
of the happiness of mankind." Viewed thus, the subject we are about to treat
presents claims superior to most others, and is eminently worthy of study. The
superintendence of a house, and the management, forethought, domestic economy,
and good sterling sense requisite for the discharge of this duty, demand
application and perseverance, and ought to receive as much, at least, as is
bestowed on the acquisition of music, painting, or any of the ornamental
accomplishments. Young ladies are educated to shine in society; would it not be
well if they were also sedulously taught--by a system of training--to perform
the homely duties which make home the abode of comfort? 
 It has been said that Americans in general have little attachment to home.
Often, indeed, is the domestic comfort, so prized in England, absent from the
abodes even of the wealthy, in our land. May not this undeniable fact, and the
roving propensity of young people in this country, be attributable to the
circumstance that girls, whose condition exempts them from servitude, are
brought up wholly without reference to home duties? Even those who may depend
on their own labor for a subsistence, are taught some trade, or superficially
qualified as teachers, or instructed in various branches of needlework; while
they know little or nothing of household matters; though such knowledge would
enable them to command an independence. It is not alone the wife and mother who
should be skilled in domestic affairs; every girl who has emerged from
childhood, is liable to be called on to take charge of a house. If the mother
is bedridden, or deceased, why should the father of daughters sixteen or
eighteen years old be compelled to look elsewhere for a housekeeper, and
intrust the management to the hands of a stranger? 
 The general cultivation of this valuable knowledge, too, would make the
occupation of a "help," or servant, more acceptable to thousands who now prefer
starvation in a garret, or the ruin of health in sedentary employments. The
more attention is turned to this branch of learning, the more will its
importance be recognized, and the higher place will it assume in the list of
useful arts; and a degree of respect being accorded to those who excel, more
will be found ready to engage in it as a profession. What an improvement would
be made, by such a result, in our social and domestic life! 
 We would not be understood to say  that we would
have a woman merely an upper servant in the house it is her province to guide,
or that we undervalue intellectual attainments and elegant occupations. But it
will not detract from the charm of these, nor from the dignity of the well-bred
lady--to be familiar with the routine of domestic duties, well acquainted with
the minuti&#230; of household economy, and competent to direct, or if need be,
teach her servants; ay, even, to do things herself in cases of necessity. On
the other hand, will it not enhance admiration and strengthen regard, to see
that she possesses these acquirements, and is willing to exercise them to
promote the comfort of others? Who can tell that she may not, at some period of
life, be thrown into circumstances where the mere fine lady would be utterly
helpless, or where intellectual refinement and distinguished position may prove
less available than industry, ingenuity, and practical common sense? 
 What is a kingdom, a merchant's counting-house, or a mechanic's workshop
without a head? We do not mean a mere master, but a presiding intellect to
plan, contrive, direct, and guide. Not less absolute or important is the rule
of a sensible woman in her own home. She has full scope for the exercise of
good taste, prudence, and refinement. She is invested with an amount of
responsibility she perhaps never dreamed of, for her influence over the temper,
habits, actions, and dispositions of those about her is very great, and great
in proportion should be her self-government, for with self the command must
begin, if it is to be worth having. 
 There is much talk, nowadays, about the "rights" and "mission" of woman.
Without entering into the merits of the subject, we would only say, that if
women, from the highest to the lowest, were systematically educated to wield
properly the great power they indubitably possess--a power which can be made to
move the secret springs of action and the machinery of business--they would
have little reason to complain of the want of influence; and were they so
trained to enter actively and energetically into domestic employments and
affairs, that none could deem it a pursuit unworthy of them, they would find
ample scope for the exercise of their faculties, and the acquisition of means
to live. 
 There is a medium, however, in all things. A woman who worries all within
her reach by her ultra-housewifery, who damps one down with soap and water,
poisons one with furniture polish, takes away one's appetite by the trouble
there is about cooking the simplest thing, and fidgets one by over-done
tidiness and cleanliness, is almost as much to be avoided as a downright slut,
or the veriest simpleton who ever took counsel with her stupid servant as to
how long a potato ought to be boiled; she exercises a pernicious influence on
all, and is a misery to herself and others. 
 Neither would we have domestic economy and home duties vaunted, or made the
constant theme of conversation; they are the private employments of a woman;
she must study other things in order to entertain her relatives and friends.
Those who talk most of their duties are generally those who perform them most
imperfectly. When a man returns to his home, or enters his sitting-room,
fatigued and perhaps disappointed by the business of the day, he does not want
to be annoyed by the detail of domestic accidents, the misdemeanors of
servants, and the cheating of tradespeople; he has had 
 his  worries during the day, too, and, with that
pride, or reserve, or want of confidence which is peculiar to most men, he
perhaps keeps them to himself. Let his example be followed in all cases where
advice, or support, or assistance is not absolutely necessary,  and pleasant, cheerful themes be chosen, or some amusement
selected which shall render the evening and leisure hours those of relaxation
and enjoyment, and tend to give a charm and zest to home which no other place
can possess. Men are free to come and go as they list, they have so much
liberty of action, so many out-door resources if wearied with in-doors, that it
is good policy, if nothing else, to make home attractive as well as
comfortable. 
 An education in household matters should be complete--comprising the
knowledge requisite for use in all departments. 
 Many a girl can make good pastry, jellies, &#38;c., for an evening party,
and being much complimented for her labors by those who relish the produce,
forthwith fancies herself a capital housewife, while, in all probability, she
scarcely knows how vegetables are cooked, is profoundly ignorant of the prices
of the commonest articles of daily consumption, and could not tell of what
material a housecloth ought to be made. And how few there are who could, in
case of need, make a cup of good gruel, or a glass of white-wine whey, or even
a little broth or barley-water! We do not say that they could not manage to
produce something resembling these things, but the capricious appetite of the
invalid would reject the tasteless messes. Many have suffered martyrdom from
this one neglected branch of female education. 
 Perhaps few branches of female education are more useful than great
readiness in figures. Accounts should be regularly kept, and not the smallest
article omitted to be entered. If balanced every week or month, the income and
outgoings will be ascertained with facility, and their proportions to each
other duly observed. Some people fix on stated sums to be appropriated to each
different article, as house, clothes, pocket, education of children, &#38;c.
Whatever may be the amount of household expenditure, a certain mode should be
adopted and strictly adhered to. Besides the regular account-book, in which the
receipt of money and every payment should be regularly entered, a common-place
book should be always at hand for the entry of observations regarding
agreements with servants, tradesmen, and various other subjects, so as to
enable the lady at once to ascertain the exact state of the affairs under her
immediate management. 
 A minute account of the annual income and the times of payment should be
taken in writing; likewise an estimate of the supposed amount of each article
of expense; and those who are early accustomed to calculations on domestic
articles will acquire so accurate a knowledge of what their establishment
requires, as will enable them to keep the happy medium between prodigality and
parsimony. 
 Some aver that they have no capacity for this matter, no taste for that. But
if the things referred to are duties, cultivate a taste--perserve in
endeavoring to improve a capacity for them. This world is a beautiful one,
spite of what grumblers say, and thousands would find it a much happier one if
they studied more what they ought to do, and sought their pleasure or indulged
their fancies less. Every human being exercises some influence on the
character, happiness and destinies of others, and is accountable for
opportunities wasted, and blessings neglected or transformed. This is
especially true of women. Every sensible, high-minded, right-hearted woman, be
she peeress or peasant--is, or may be, a blessing to many; if not by great
deeds or achievements the world calls heroic, by a simple, quiet,
straightforward performance of the duties which lie before her, and are
therefore given her to do.  
 As it is the business of man to provide the means of living comfortably, so
it is the province of woman to dispose judiciously of those means, and maintain
order and harmony in all things. On her due performance of her part rest the
comfort and social peace of home; while misery and ruin follow her neglect.
Some women, it is true, are placed in an unnatural position by having the
burden of supporting the family thrown upon them. They have double duties, and
a harder part to sustain; but their toils may be materially lightened by care
and method in what they have to do. 
 So much by way of exordium. We shall now proceed through the various matters
appertaining to a house, endeavoring to present a clear chart of the necessary
business, pointing out hidden rocks, and showing how these may be avoided, and
the vessel sent to float in calm waters. With much labor we have
collected information on all subjects that fall within the proper scope of
housekeeping; and multifarious as these are, it is our belief that she who
consults our index will be sure to find whatever she can wish to know. 
 
 
 CHAPTER II. 
 THAT sensible and oft-quoted old lady, Mrs. Glasse, begins one of her
recipes thus: "First catch your hare." Following so good an example, we will
first take a house and furnish it, before laying down axioms for its
management. 
 Before any steps are taken, the income or pecuniary means of the parties
about to commence housekeeping, should be well considered. It is not well to
rush into matrimony without due attention to such sublunary matters as dollars
and cents; for the notion that when once a couple is married, all will go
right, is a foolish one. A young man with an income of four or five hundred
dollars, every cent of which has been annually swallowed up by his own
expenses, falls in love with a young lady who can sing and play well, speak
French and produce marvels in the way of crochet or ornamental work, who loves
sentimental poetry and romance, and can trim herself a neat bonnet; but knows
little of the realities of life. Having never known what it is to want any
thing--she has no idea that any thing can be wanted. The young man feels
certain in his own mind that a wife will be an actual saving to him; and makes
an eloquent declaration of his affection. The prospect for the future is but
slender; for he ignores the fact that he has been accustomed to spend half his
income on clothes and amusements, which he does not think of doing without; and
she forgets how much she is in the habit of spending on gloves, ribbons,
perfumes, et cetera. When they are married--the bridal dress and entertainment
not being reckoned among their expenses--they find themselves fettered by a
thousand inconveniences, and obliged to deny themselves travelling and many
other kinds of recreation; more than that, they discover that the etiquette of
this enlightened age, imperiously demands reckless expenditure, when common
sense would advise more than usual economy; and without losing the social
position they aim to preserve, they can do nothing but submit. What an effect
on the success of after-life must be such a beginning! 
 However, we do not consider it our mission to enter on Quixotic quarrels
with the ways of the world. It is, as our young people soon find-- 
 "A very good world to live in, To lend, to spend, or to
give in; But to beg, or borrow, or get one's own, 'Tis the very worst
world that ever was known." 
 In taking a house, the first matters to  be
considered, are the rent we can afford to give, or the money that can be
devoted to its purchase, and the locality that suits us best. 
 A dwelling in town affords many opportunities for social intercourse,
amusement, and the acquisition of general knowledge; a suburban residence
offers some advantages in healthiness of location and convenience.
