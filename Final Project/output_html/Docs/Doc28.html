 PREFACE. 
 In March last, the Ladies Society of the First Presbyterian Church, of
Dayton, hastily compiled and published a "Cook Book," or a small collection of
recipes for plain household cooking. Five hundred copies were published, and,
notwithstanding the book contained some errors, and the arrangement was very
imperfect (necessarily so from the haste with which it was prepared for
publication), it met with such gratifying and unexpected success, that its
authors felt it to be their duty to revise and re-publish it. 
 The present book is much larger than its predecessor, and the recipes it
contains have been selected with great care. Many of them were sent voluntarily
by parties who were willing to hold themselves responsible for their
excellence, while others were solicited, often at the cost of much time and
pains--a corn bread here, a pudding there, a salad from some one else--from
ladies who had gained a reputation for preparing this or that particular
dish. 
 Our subject is an inexhaustable one, and this book does not venture into the
mystical realm of fancy cookery; but is a collection of safe and reliable
recipes for the preparation of plain food. 
 The matter of the book, we claim, is all right; for the manner of it, we beg
indulgence. The phraseology is often peculiar, and
may provoke a smile; but it must be remembered that the recipes were written by
ladies unaccustomed to writing for publication; and, in most cases, they have
been inserted precisely as written, and, whenever no objection was made, the
name of the author has been given. 
 Persons familiar with Dayton names, will recognize many who do not belong to
the Presbyterian sisterhood. We feel ourselves under great obligations to the
ladies who have assisted us, but we hope our book will prove so useful as to
amply repay them for their trouble. 
 DAYTON, OHIO, July 1, 1873. 
 "What is worth doing at all, is worth doing well."  
 
  
 
 SOUP. 
 A few points are essential in making good soup. Beef is the best meat for
the purpose, as it contains the most nourishment. A shank bone should be well
cracked (that the marrow may be extracted), put on to cook in cold water,
allowing a full quart for every pound of beef, and by very gradual heat come to
a slow simmer, which should be kept up five or six hours. Soup, on no account,
should be allowed to boil, except for the last fifteen minutes, to cook the
vegetables in finishing. For the first hour of simmering it should be
frequently skimmed. Salt, pepper and savory should be cooked in it from the
first; rice, tapioca, macaroni or dumplings added at the last, to thicken. If
vegetables are desired, they should be nicely sliced. Soup is much better to be
made and allowed to cool, and used the second day, as then all grease can be
removed. It should be strained before putting away. 
 
  BEEF SOUP. 
 Mrs. John G. Lowe. Put on a
 shin of beef  early in the morning. An hour before
dinner put in the
 vegetables -- corn, 
 tomatoes,   potatoes,  or any
other the season affords. Half an hour before dinner add  pearl
barley,   vermicelli, or dumplings,  as you
prefer. Season with  salt, 
 pepper  and  catsup,  to
taste. 
  
 
  BEAN SOUP. 
 Mrs. Axie Green. To a quart of
 beans  a teaspoonful of  soda. 
Cover well with  water,  and set them on to boil until
the hulls will easily slip off; throw them into  cold
water;  rub well with the hands; the hulls will rise to the top.
Drain carefully and repeat until the hulls are wholly removed. To a quart of
 beans,  two quarts of  water. 
Boil until the  beans  mash perfectly smooth. It seasons
the soup to boil a  piece of meat (mutton, beef or
pork)  with it.  If you have not meat, add
 butter  and  flour  rubbed
together.  Break into  tureen  well
 toasted bread,  pour over it the soup, and add plenty
of  salt  and  pepper.  
 
 
  CORN SOUP. 
 Mrs. S. B. Smith. Clean and scrape
twelve  ears of corn.  Boil the
 cobs  for fifteen or twenty minutes in one quart of
 water;  remove them and put in the
 corn.  Let it boil a short time, then add two quarts of
 rich milk.  Season with
 pepper,   salt,  and
 butter  that has been melted enough to rub
 flour  into it (two tablespoonsful of flour). Let the
whole boil ten minutes, and then turn the soup into a
 tureen  into which the  yolks of three
eggs  have been beaten. 
 
 
  TOMATO SOUP. 
 Mrs. Simon Gebhart. One quart of
 tomatoes,  one quart of  milk 
and one quart of  water.  Boil the
 water  and  tomatoes  together
about twenty minutes, and then add the  milk;  then one
teaspoonful of  soda.  Let it just boil up. Season as
you do oyster soup, with  butter, 
 pepper  and  salt;  add
 crackers  if desired. 
 
 
  OKRA GUMBO. 
 Mrs. S. Craighead. Cut up one
 chicken  (an old one is preferable); wash and dry it;
 flour  it well;  salt  and
 pepper;  have ready in a  skillet 
a lump of  lard  as large as an
 egg;  let it get hot; put in your  chicken;  fry very brown all over,
but do not let it burn. Put it in your vessel in which you make soup; pour on
it five quarts of  water;  let it boil two hours; then
cut up about two dozen  okra pods  and add to it; be
sure they are tender and pretty well grown; then let it boil another hour. When
you first put on your soup, cut up an  onion  in it;
 salt  and  pepper  to taste. To
be served with  rice, either boiled or steamed dry. 
  Dried okra  can be used by being put to soak
the night previous; pour off most of the
 water.   
 
 
  PLAIN GUMBO SOUP. Take a piece of
 ham  half the size of your hand, and a
 knuckle of veal;  put them in a pot with two quarts of
 cold water,  simmer slowly two or three hours, then add
two quarts of  boiling water.  Twenty minutes before
serving, put in one small  can of okra  and as many
 oysters  as you please. Season to taste. 
 
 
  PLAIN CALF'S HEAD SOUP. 
 Mrs. S. Craighead. Take a
 calf's head  well cleaned, and a  knuckle of
veal;  put them into a large porcelain vessel; put a large
tablespoonful of  sweet marjoram,  and one of
 sweet basil,  in a clean rag; also a large
 onion  cut up in a cloth; take at least four quarts of
 water  (it must be started as early as eight o'clock,
if you wish it for a one o'clock dinner); let it boil steadily but not too
rapidly;  salt  and  pepper 
well. About twelve o'clock, take off the soup, pour it through a
 cullender,  pick out all the
 meat  carefully, chop very fine and return it to the
soup, placing again upon the fire. Boil four  eggs very
hard;  chop them fine, and slice one  lemon 
very thin, and at last add a wine glass of  wine.  
 
 
  CORN AND TOMATO SOUP. 
 Mrs. S. Craighead. Take a good
 soup bone;  wash it nicely; pour over it sufficient
 water  to cover it well; cut up an
 onion  in it;  salt  and  pepper;  cut down about one
dozen  ears of corn  and as many
 tomatoes  in it, and let it boil slowly for at least
three hours. For dumplings, take one  egg  and beat it a
little; one coffee-cup  sour milk;  small teaspoonful of
 soda;  a little  salt;  and
 flour  enough to make a stiff batter; drop it into the
boiling soup, from a spoon, twenty minutes before serving.  These
dumplings are good in  bean soup  also.  
 
 
  GREEN PEA SOUP. 
 Mrs. Eliza Pierce. One peck
 green peas;  four tablespoonsful of
 lard  heated in the kettle; put in the
 peas  and stir them till perfectly green; add
 pepper  and  salt,  and pour in
as much  water  as you want soup; boil three-fourths of
an hour, then add one teacupful of  milk  thickened with
a tablespoonful of  flour;  put in the soup three or
four young  onions  cut fine and fried a light brown in
 butter.  Just as you take it up, add  yolks
of two eggs,  beaten in a little
 cream.  
 
 
  PEA SOUP. 
 Mrs. Robert Buchanan. Boil the hulls
with a  chicken or knuckle of veal,  then strain the
liquid; throw in a handful of  peas,  and boil to
thicken the soup; when done, put in some  peas  cooked
separately,  pepper  and  salt, 
 cream  and  butter  to
taste. 
 
 
  MACARONI SOUP. Take six pounds of
 beef,  and put into four quarts of
 water,  with two  onions,  one
 carrot,  one  turnip,  and a
 head of celery;  boil it down three or four hours
slowly, till there is about two quarts of  water;  then
let it cool. Next day, half an hour before dinner, take off the grease and pour
the soup into the kettle (leaving the sediment out) and add
 salt  to suit the taste; a pint of
 macaroni  broken into inch pieces, and a tablespoonful
and a half of  tomato catsup.  
  
 
  NOODLES FOR SOUP. Beat up one
 egg;  add a pinch of  salt  and
 flour  enough to make a stiff dough; roll out in a very
thin sheet; dredge with  flour  to keep from sticking;
then roll up tightly; begin at one end and shave down fine like cabbage for
slaw. 
 
 
  MEAT BALLS. Half a pound of
 lean veal  and a pound of  fat
beef  chopped fine; a tablespoonful of
 thyme,  one of  parsley,  a
little less  marjoram  and a little more
 onion,  a pinch of  mace, 
 cloves  and  nutmeg,  the
 yolks of two eggs,  a little  crumbled
bread,   pepper  and
 salt;  mix with the hand in a large bowl; mould into
balls the size of a walnut,and fry in  lard.  After
frying the balls, make a browning of the  lard  they are
fried in (put  flour  in and stir until well cooked) and
brown the soup with it; put the balls in the soup whole. 
 
 
  DUMPLINGS. Take a small teacupful of
 flour,  a pinch of  salt,  and
 butter  the size of a walnut; rub well with the
 flour;  sprinkle in a little
 pepper;  add  sweet milk  enough
to form a stiff dough;  flour  the board and roll very
thin; cut in small squares; drop into the soup, and let them boil ten
minutes. 
 
 
  
 FISH. 
 
  BOILED FISH. All large
 fish,  with the skin whole, should be wrapped in a
cloth, wound with twine, and covered with more than two inches of
 cold water.  In the  water  put
a little  flour;  a small lump of
 butter;  a chopped  onion  and
 parsley.  Be careful not to have too much water. After
the  fish  has boiled sufficiently, take the
 yolks of four eggs;  the  juice of one
lemon;  a little  mace;  and about a gill of
the  water  in which the  fish 
has been boiled; put all into a  stew pan  and let boil
until it thickens; stirring all the time; then pour over the
 fish.  
 
 
  FRIED FISH. Having cleaned the
 fish  thoroughly, wipe dry; sprinkle with
 salt;  dust thick with  flour. 
Take  yolks of four eggs;  beat tolerably light. Put a
little  sweet oil  in the frying pan, and let it be
boiling. Dip the  fish  in the batter; put them in the
pan and fry slowly.  Fish  should not be put in to fry
until the  fat  gets boiling hot. It is very necessary
to observe this rule. 
 
 
  BAKED FISH. 
 Mrs. Geo. L. Phillips. After cleaning,
 salt  the  fish  for about an
hour, then wash it. Make a dressing of  bread crumbs, 
 salt  and  pepper, 
 summer savory,  and a piece
of  butter  the size of a walnut. Then put in a pan and
sprinkle with  flour;  put on a little
 butter,   pepper, 
 salt  and about half a pint of
 water.  Bake an hour and a half. 
 
 
  BAKED CODFISH. Soak the
 codfish  over night; clean it off with a brush kept for
that purpose; then put it into a stone crock and cover with
 water.  Let it simmer until quite tender, then take it
out, pick it over, and mash it fine. Take two-thirds  mashed
potatoes,  seasoned with  butter  and
 salt,  and one-third  codfish; 
mix well together and bake in a dish until brown; then make a  sauce
of drawn butter,  and cut up two  hard boiled
eggs  into it. 
 
 
  STEWED CODFISH. 
 Mrs. Isaac Van Ausdal. Pick the
 codfish  into small pieces; cover it with
 cold water  and let it remain over night. In the
morning pour that off, and put on some  boiling water. 
Let it stand a few minutes, then drain, and stir it up, with two tablespoonsful
of  cream  and a lump of  butter 
the size of an egg. Let it come to the boil, and serve with fresh boiled
 potatoes.  
 
 
  FISH FRITTERS. 
 Mrs. J. A. McMahon. Take the remains
of any  fish  which has been served the preceding day;
remove all the bones, and pound in a mortar; add  bread
crumbs  and  mashed potatoes  in equal
quantities. Mix half a teacupful of  cream  with two
well beaten  eggs,   cayenne
pepper  and  anchovy sauce;  beat all up to
a proper consistency; cut it into small cakes, and fry them in boiling
 lard.  
 
 
  CLAM FRITTERS. Twelve
 clams  minced fine; one pint of
 milk;  three  eggs.  Add the
 liquor from the clams  to the
 milk;  beat up the  eggs  and
put to this  salt,   pepper,  and
 flour  enough for a thin batter; lastly the chopped  clams. 
Fry in  hot lard.  A tablespoonful makes a fritter, or
you can dip the whole  clam  in batter and cook in like
manner. 
 
 
  FISH SAUCE. Stir in one cup of
 drawn butter  the  yolks of two
eggs  well beaten,  pepper  and
 salt,  and a few  sprigs of
parsley;  let it boil, and pour over the
 fish  when ready for the table. 
 
 
  ANOTHER SAUCE FOR FISH.

 butter  size of two eggs; melt and mix with it one-hal...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(44%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic12.html>put sugar boil butter water pound salt half eggs flour</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic11.html>water half milk sugar butter eggs add salt cream cupful</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mrs cup half teaspoonful sugar flour milk add cake soda</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic17.html>add sugar cup eggs flour cake hot cream bread water</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>water tea table place put made cold half warm make</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
