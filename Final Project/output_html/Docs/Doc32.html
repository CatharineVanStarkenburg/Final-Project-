 TO MY FRIEND MRS. ELLEN EWING SHERMAN, A LADY WHO
STUDIES THE COMFORTS OF HER HOUSEHOLD, THESE RECEIPTS ARE
AFFECTIONATELY  Dedicated.       
  PREFACE. 
 THE aim of this book is to indicate how to serve dishes, and to entertain
company at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, as well as to give cooking receipts.
Too many receipts are avoided, although quite enough are furnished for any
practical cook-book. There are generally only two or three really good modes of
cooking a material, and one becomes bewildered and discouraged in trying to
select and practice from books which contain often from a thousand to three
thousand receipts. 
 No claim is laid to originality. "Receipts which have not stood the test of
time and experience are of but little worth." The author has willingly availed
herself of the labors of others, and, having carefully compared existing
works--adding here and subtracting there, as experience dictated--and having
also pursued courses of study with cooking teachers in America and in Europe,
she hopes that she has produced a simple and practical book, which will enable
a family to live well and in good style, and, at the same time, with reasonable
economy. 
 The absence from previous publications of reliable
  information as to the manner of serving
meals has been noticed. Fortunately, the fashionable mode is one calculated to
give the least anxiety and trouble to a hostess. 
 Care has been taken to show how it is possible with moderate means to keep a
hospitable table, leaving each reader for herself to consider the manifold
advantages of making home, so far as good living is concerned, comfortable and
happy.
