 PREFACE. 

 IT is with diffidence that I come before the public as an Authoress, even to this little work; I have no pretensions to the originality of the whole of the receipts herein contained, it is due to those LADIES who have gone before me. 

 THE improvement of the rising generation of  Females,  in our Country, was the motive which prompted me to this undertaking. 

 IT is not so much for the  Lady  of fashion, and fortune, as for those in the more humble walks of life, who by the loss of parents, or other unfortunate circumstances, are reduced to indigence. - The orphan, tho' left to the care of a virtuous guardian, will find it essentially necessary to have an opinion of her own. 

 BY having an opinion of her own, I would not be understood to mean an obstinate perseverance in trifles. It must ever remain a check upon the solitary orphan, that while those females who have parents, or brothers, or riches, to defend their indiscretions, that she must solely depend on  character.  How important then, that every action,

 

word, and thought, be regulated by the strictest purity, and every movement meet the approbation of the good and wise. If this treatise should tend in any way to guide the inexperienced Female in the Art of Cooking, and relieve them from that embarrassment, which they must otherwise experience it would be an ample compensation for this undertaking. 

 THE American Ladies are solicited to cast the veil of charity over those imperfections that may be found. Should any future edition appear, she hopes to render it more valuable. L.E.

 DIRECTIONS for procuring the best FLESH, VEGETABLES, &amp;c. 

 How to choose Flesh.  

  BEEF.  The large stall fed  ox beef  is the best, it has a coarse open grain, and oily smoothness; dent it with your finger and it will immediately rise again; if old, it will be rough and spungy, and the dent remain. 

  Cow Beef  is less boned, and generally more tender and juicy than the ox, in America, which is used to labor. 

   Mutton,   grass-fed, is good two or three years old. 

   Lamb,   if under six months is rich, and no danger of imposition; it may be known by its size, in distinguishing either. 

   Veal,   is soon lost---great care therefore is necessary in purchasing.  Veal  bro't to market in panniers, or in carriages, is to be preferred to that bro't in bags, and flouncing on a sweaty horse. 

   Pork,   is known by its size, and whether properly fattened by its appearance. 

 Fish, how to choose the best in market. 

   Salmon,   the noblest and richest  fish  taken in fresh water---the largest are the best. They are unlike almost every other  fish,  are ameliorated by being 3 or 4 days out of  water,  if kept from heat and the moon, which has much more injurious effect than the sun. 

 In all great fish-markets, great fish-mongers strictly examine the gills - if the bright redness is exchanged for a low brown, they are stale; but when live  fish  are brought flouncing into market,

 

you have only to select the kind most agreeable to your palate and the season. 

   Shad,   contrary to the generally received opinion are not so much richer flavored, as they are harder when first taken out of the water; opinions vary respecting them. I have tasted  Shad  thirty or forty miles from the place where caught, and really conceived that they had a richness of flavor, which did not appertain to those taken fre...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(44%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic12.html>put sugar boil butter water pound salt half eggs flour</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(26%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>put till small half table spoonful pan paste water stew</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>put serve fire salt add butter cut sauce water half</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>water tea table place put made cold half warm make</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
