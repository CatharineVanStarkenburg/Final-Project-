 PREFACE 
 
In this, my book, I have endeavored to give expression to the art of cookery as developed in recent years in keeping with the importance of the catering business, in particular the hotel business, which, in America, now leads the world.
 
 
I have been fortunate in studying under the great masters of the art in Europe and America; and since my graduation as Chef I have made several journeys of observations to New York, and to England, France and Switzerland to learn the new in cooking and catering.
 
 
I have named my book The Hotel St. Francis Cook Book in compliment to the house which has given me in so generous measure the opportunity to produce and reproduce, always with the object of reflecting a cuisine that is the best possible.
 
 
The recipes in my book calling for wines and liqueurs for flavoring may be followed by those whose legitimate supplies are not used up; and where these cannot be had there are non-alcoholic substitutes available with the flavor near perfect. The juice of lemons will serve in many cases to give agreeable flavor.
 
 
The spaces left open in the pages of the book are for the purpose of affording convenient place for writing in additional recipes. The paper on which the book is printed is specially selected for this purpose.
 
 
VICTOR HIRTZLER.
